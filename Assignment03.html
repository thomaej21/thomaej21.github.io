<H1> Plans for after college<br></H1>
 After college I plan on applying to medical school. I think one of the best places to go to medical school would be <b>New york University Medical school.ADD link to page.</b><br>
 While going to medical school in new york would be somethink amazing there is one problem. NYU only has a 2% acceptance rate so the chances that  get accepted are <i>VERY LOW.</i><br>
 Juniata will hopefully supply me with a good enough education to do well on the mcat so that I can get into another medical school of similar merit because going somewhere good for med school<br>
 is my dream. Aditionally NYU is a tutition free school so I would graduate debt free and I could start my life without the finantial bruden of going to professional school.
