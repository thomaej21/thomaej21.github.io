<H1> Plans for after college<br></H1>
 <a href=“http://www.juniata.edu”></a>
 <p>After college I plan on applying to medical school. I think one of the best places to go to medical school would be <b>New york University Medical school.ADD link to page.</b><br>
 While going to medical school in new york would be somethink amazing there is one problem. NYU only has a 2% acceptance rate so the chances that  get accepted are <i>VERY LOW.</i><br>
 Juniata will hopefully supply me with a good enough education to do well on the mcat so that I can get into another medical school of similar merit because going somewhere good for med school<br>
 is my dream. Aditionally NYU is a tutition free school so I would graduate debt free and I could start my life without the finantial bruden of going to professional school.<br>
 <H2> Plans to pay for professional school</H2><br></p>
 <p>There are lots of ways that people pay for professional school but in my mind there is <u>3-4 different</u> ways people normally do it. The first way which is the worst one is paying for it out of pocket<br>
 This would be that you just take out loans and slowly pay it back over the course of your career this is something the the majority of people do however I would like to avoid this route <br>
 if possible. The second way that people pay for it is by getting a full ride to a school. While I would love for this to happen to me I doubt that I have the experience or intelect to merit a full ride<br>
 to a good medical school. Next is through the military. I have been considerin this option because they cancel your debt through military service as a doctor after tou graduate but I am still far away from finding<br>
 Picking a medical school so i dont neeed to choose an option yet. And lastly if you work as a doctor in a rural area or place they sometimes cancel debt for doing that as well however <br>
 I would only consider this option if I wanted to work in the areas that are offering this program.</p>
